# ImageP
 Image Processing â€“ A minimalistic Python replacement of ImageJ.

ImageP was developed during an experiment for Fluid Physics (second year BSc course Applied Physics) to streamline data processing of a rotating cylindrical body of water. It was further developed into a proper application for future use and as a fun sideproject to learn PyQt.

Please refer to the [documentation](https://github.com/JitseB/ImageP/blob/main/DOCUMENTATION.md) for a clear example on how to use the class properly.
